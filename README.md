# üíß Water Infiltration Web3 App

This project is a Web3 application that encourages households to implement rainwater retention measures (such as green roofs, rain barrels, etc.). When a measure is approved, the household receives token rewards via smart contracts on the Ethereum testnet blockchain. [Flow Architecture](FLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md), [ERD](ERD.md).

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ **Dashboard**  
Users can see an overview of their water retention measures, their status and token balance.

‚úÖ **Register measures**  
Users can upload photos and explanations of their water retention measures.

‚úÖ **Supervisor approval**  
A designated supervisor verifies and approves/rejects submitted measures. After approval, the user receives tokens as a reward and both ends will see the tx ID links.

‚úÖ **Token rewards**  
Once approved, users receive tokens via smart contracts on the Ethereum testnet blockchain.

‚úÖ **Wallet overview**  
Users can view their token balance and the recent transactions to their wallet with tx ID links.

‚úÖ **Wallet creation**  
After registration, a wallet is automatically created for the user and prompted with the wallet private key (they only need this if they lose their account credentials), allowing them to receive tokens.

‚úÖ **Fully dynamic authentication**  
Every endpoint is protected by authentication with roles and JWTokens, and users can register, log in, and log out. Only the supervisor can approve measures, secured contract in the backend.

‚úÖ **Fully dynamic authentication**  
No web3 wallet or tx signing is required for users and supervisors! Everything is handled in the backend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- **Backend:** [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) with **Kotlin** (Java 21) & Gradle KOTLIN DSL
- **Database:** H2 SQL in memory database
- **Blockchain:**  
    - The backend uses a web3j to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum testnet.
    - Using the Metamask Infura RPC provider for blockchain interactions.
    - The ContractService is integrated with backend API endpoints to handle blockchain operations.
    - All blockchain operations are handled securely in the backend, so users do not need to interact with the blockchain directly.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and user roles
- **Smart Contract:**  
    - The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum testnet.
    - The contract allows minting tokens, transferring tokens, and querying balances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the project
> **Note:** You will need blockchain environment keys (`WEB3J_RPC_URL`, `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`) to run the backend. Ask your team members for these keys.


### üåê Frontend
Runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

UNIX or (windows execute 1 by 1)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Backend
Runs at [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)

UNIX
```bash
cd backend
./gradlew build
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

WINDOWS (execute 1 by 1)
```bash
cd backend
.\gradlew build
.\gradlew bootRun
```

### üóÑÔ∏è H2 Database Access
The backend uses an in-memory H2 database, which is automatically created and populated with initial data on startup. You can access the H2 console at [http://localhost:8085/h2-console](http://localhost:8085/h2-console). The ONLY credentials you need to alter after visiting the console is JDBC URL: and you can find this almost at the bottom of the backend console under 
```2025-06-14T20:22:05.051+02:00  INFO 13696 --- [backend] [  restartedMain] o.s.b.a.h2.H2ConsoleAutoConfiguration    : H2 console available at '/h2-console'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:a2d7ebf9-0e5b-4f6e-acb7-0441b5a68ea0'``` in this case the JDBC URL is `jdbc:h2:mem:a2d7ebf9-0e5b-4f6e-acb7-0441b5a68ea0`. This changes every time you restart the backend, so you will need to update it accordingly.
